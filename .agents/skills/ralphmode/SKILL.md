# Ralphmode

Ralphmode is a cross-platform permission profile for long-running `ralph` or `jeo` workflows.
It reduces approval friction, but it is not "allow everything everywhere."
The core rule is simple: widen automation only inside a bounded project or disposable sandbox, and keep secrets plus destructive commands explicitly blocked.

## When to use this skill

- You want `ralph` to iterate without repeated approval popups.
- You are setting up the same repo for Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI.
- You need a shared safety model: repo-only writes, no secrets reads, no destructive shell by default.
- You want a stronger separation between day-to-day automation and true YOLO mode.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Define the automation boundary first

Before changing any permission mode:

- Pick one project root and keep automation scoped there.
- List files and commands that must stay blocked: `.env*`, `secrets/**`, production credentials, `rm -rf`, `sudo`, unchecked `curl | sh`.
- Decide whether this is a normal repo or a disposable sandbox.

If the answer is "disposable sandbox," you may use the platform's highest-autonomy mode.
If not, use the repo-scoped preset instead.

### Step 2: Choose one preset per platform

Use only the section that matches the current tool:

- Claude Code: everyday preset first, `bypassPermissions` only for isolated sandboxes.
- Codex CLI: use the current official approval and sandbox model first; treat older `permissions.allow` and `permissions.deny` snippets as compatibility-only.
- Gemini CLI: trust only the project root; there is no true global YOLO mode.

Detailed templates live in [references/permission-profiles.md](./references/permission-profiles.md).

### Step 3: Apply the profile locally, not globally, unless the workspace is disposable

Prefer project-local configuration over user-global defaults.

- Claude Code: start with project `.claude/settings.json`.
- Codex CLI: start with project config and repo instructions or rules files.
- Gemini CLI: trust the current folder, not `~/` or broad parent directories.

If you must use a user-global default, pair it with a stricter denylist and a sandbox boundary.

### Step 4: Run Ralph with an explicit verification loop

After permissions are configured:

1. Confirm the task and acceptance criteria.
2. Run `ralph` or the `jeo` plan-execute-verify loop.
3. Verify outputs before claiming completion.
4. If the automation profile was temporary, revert it after the run.

Recommended execution contract:

```text
boundary check -> permission profile -> ralph run -> verify -> cleanup or revert
```

### Step 5: Keep "skip" and "safe" separate

Treat these as different modes:

- Repo automation: minimal prompts inside a bounded workspace.
- Sandbox YOLO: promptless execution in a disposable environment only.

Do not collapse them into one shared team default.

## Examples

### Example 1: Claude Code sandbox run

Use the Claude sandbox preset from [references/permission-profiles.md](./references/permission-profiles.md), then run Ralph only inside that isolated repo:

```bash
/ralph "fix all failing tests" --max-iterations=10
```

### Example 2: Codex CLI repo-scoped Ralph run

Apply the Codex repo preset from [references/permission-profiles.md](./references/permission-profiles.md), then run the task.
The current official model uses config file settings, not CLI flag overrides:

```toml
approval_policy = "never"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
```

Place this in `~/.codex/config.toml` (or a project-local override) and restart Codex before running Ralph.

### Example 3: Gemini CLI trust-only setup

Trust the current project folder, keep explicit file selection, then run the Ralph workflow for that repo only.

## Best practices

- Default to the least-permissive preset that still lets Ralph finish end-to-end.
- Keep secret denylists and destructive command denylists even when approvals are reduced.
- Use full bypass only in disposable environments with a clear project boundary.
- Record which preset was applied so teammates can reproduce or revert it.
- Re-check platform docs when upgrading CLI versions because permission models change faster than skill content.
